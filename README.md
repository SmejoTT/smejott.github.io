## [French peg solitaire](https://smejott.github.io/french-peg-solitaire/)
French peg solitaire is a [**classical solitaire board game**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire). There exists a lot of versions of this game but I implemented the French/European version because that one I played in
real life. The reason I decided to implement the game was that when playing in real-life I got annoyed by restarting the game manually as there are 36 pieces.
It had success with people who know the game or love puzzles. If you are one of these people or just curious go and 
[**try for yourself**](https://smejott.github.io/french-peg-solitaire/) if you can beat it.
